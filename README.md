# 🧑‍🔬 Data Scientist To-Do List 📝  

Because data scientists don’t just wrangle data, they also wrangle their lives.  

---

## 🚀 About the Project  
This is a **fun little To-Do List app** I built for myself — but hey, it’s deployed on **Vercel**, so anyone can use it!  
Whether you’re forgetting to write that SQL query, or just need to remind yourself to touch grass 🌱, this app’s got your back.  

**Key Features:**  
- ➕ Add tasks like “Fix random seed” or “Convince model to stop overfitting.”  
- ✅ Mark tasks as done (finally, some closure).  
- ❌ Delete tasks (just like we delete columns we don’t understand).  
- 🎁 **Special Reward:** Complete ALL your tasks and unlock a **gift with a motivational quote**. Because sometimes you deserve more than just an empty list.  
- ☁️ Fully deployed on Vercel — use it anywhere, even while crying over Kaggle.
